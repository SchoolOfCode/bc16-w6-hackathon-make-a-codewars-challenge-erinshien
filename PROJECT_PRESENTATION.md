# SoC Hackathon Week 6 - Erin Smith

## MVPS

MVP 1 - Challenge to sort an array of strings in alphabetical order by the final letter in the string, e.g. [ ]
MVP 2 - Challenge to sort an array of first and last names in alphabetical order by the final letter of the first name, e.g. [ ]

## My Kata Scenario

Adam Aardvark is fed up of being chosen first in class. His teacher always picks on students in alphabetical order by the first letter of their last name - and with a last name like that, Adam has no chance! He thinks a better way to alphabetically order the class would be by the last letter of their first names, so he can sit comfortably in the middle.

Write a function that takes in an array of names and returns an array where the names are sorted in alphabetical order in reverse - last letter takes priority, then the second last letter, and so on.

## The Plan
