/**
 * Adam Aardvark is fed up of being chosen first in class. His teacher always picks on students in alphabetical order by the first letter of their last name - and with a last name like that, Adam has no chance! He thinks a better way to alphabetically order the class would be by the last letter of their first names, so he can sit comfortably in the middle.
 *
 * Write a function that takes in an array of names and returns an array where the names are sorted in alphabetical order in reverse - the last letter of each name takes priority, then the second last letter, and so on.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *  `[ 'Neal', 'Peter', 'Elizabeth', 'Sara', 'Kate' ]` should return the following ->
 *  `[ 'Sara', 'Kate', 'Elizabeth', 'Neal', 'Peter' ]
 *
 *  The final letter of 'Sara' is 'a', so it goes first. The final letter of 'Kate' is 'e', so it goes next, etc.
